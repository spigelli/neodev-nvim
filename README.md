Installation üõ†Ô∏è
----------------

To install neodev-nvim, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neodev-nvim.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, run the setup.sh script to symlink the configuration files into the correct directory and add them to your path:

```bash
cd neodev-nvim
./setup.sh
```

Note that neodev-nvim requires the nightly version of neovim in order to work properly, as it makes use of the NVIM\_APPNAME environment variable to specify the base directory for XDG\_HOME, XDG\_STATE, and XDG\_SHARE.
